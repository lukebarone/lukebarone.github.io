About Me
===

I'm a SysAdmin who loves dealing with Linux and Windows Servers. I have a passion for coding scripts, and having the computer do my work for me.

I have love automation - through Python3, Ansible, Bash Scripting, Batch/CMD scripting, Powershell scripts, or BadUSB keyboard injection. They are all loved for various reasons, depending on my situation.

I have been using Windows since 1992, with version 3, and still do to the latest versions of Windows 10. I have been using Mac OSX since 2009, and Linux full time since 2018.

My projects are sorted into two categories - helpful for me to do my job quickly, and potentially helpful to others.

Favourite Technologies to use

<dl>
    <dt>Ansible</dt>
    <dd>Playbooks are essential for setting up infrastructure quickly! I love being able to test out and roll out configuration changes in a safe, reliable manner. Add in `git`, and you can roll back anytime! 5 stars!</dd>
    <dt>Python3</dt>
    <dd><p>Although I am only learning at this point, this has been a great tool for automation where scripts in Bash simply won't work. I have scripts to scrape info from many status-checking websites; I have scripts that interact with network equipment over SSH that won't access shell scripts or SSH Keys. Add in the amazing projects based on it, and you'll fall in love with it too!</p><p>All my repositories with Python Scripts will be checked against <a href="http://pep8online.com/">PEP Online</a> before being committed to Master</p></dd>
    <dt>Bash Scripting</dt>
    <dd><p>One thing Linux does well is that it has commands that do one thing, and one thing WELL! Then, add in the pipeline, and you can create very complex, multi-tiered scripts that can start thinking for themselves. The most critical for dealing with Linux Servers in general - user management, permission management, or installing new packages for your users.</p><p>All my repositories with Bash scripts will be checked against <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/">ShellCheck</a> before being commited to Master</p></dd>
